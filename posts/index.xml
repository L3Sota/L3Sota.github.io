      <description>Chia vs. Bitcoin I wrote up an explanation of Chia and its benefits vs. Bitcoin in Japanese. There are better resources out there in English regarding the various comparisons, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be brief in this English version.
Power (Electricity) Consumption There are a lot of English articles on the topic of Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s power consumption (I like this one from Princeton, and Cambridge has a fun interactive tool).
