Quick post to bring attention to "pre-sale" Chia (XCH). tl;dr **They're all scams**! ([Relevant Tweet](https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/1375958173576622083) from @bramcohen)

Here's some justification. The latest business whitepaper is available at [https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia-Business-Whitepaper-2021-02-09-v1.0.pdf](https://www.chia.net/assets/Chia-Business-Whitepaper-2021-02-09-v1.0.pdf), and all my claims are cited from there.

1. Chia Network (The Company) has a **21 million XCH** pre-farm as The Strategic Reserve (p. 4 "Company Vision" paragraph 4, p. 15 "The Strategic Reserve"). (So yes, the company *does* have a stash.)
2. Transactions have not launched yet (p. 6 "Company Milestones" subsection "Beta Stage:" paragraph 6). **It is impossible for anyone to transfer XCH to anyone else**.
3. **The Company will not sell Chia from The Strategic Reserve** (p. 20 "Controls on the Strategic Reserve" paragraph 6 list item 1).

So nobody can sell you XCH right now; they can only take your money and "promise" you to transfer the XCH when transactions are launched. It also is definitely not The Company (since they declared that they won't sell their reserve), so anyone claiming to be affiliated with them or otherwise "official" is *lying*.

So, when *will* transactions be launched? The current target is six weeks after mainnet launch (p. 6 "Company Milestones" subsection "Beta Stage:" paragraph 6). [Mainnet launched on 2021-03-19](https://www.chia.net/2021/03/17/Chia-1.0.html), so transactions are expected to launch around 2021-04-30. That means, **until the end of April, anyone claiming to sell XCH is absolutely lying to you**. You'll have to see what your options are after that.

Beware!
