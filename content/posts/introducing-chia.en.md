I've been passively following the [Chia](https://www.chia.net) project since signing up for their newsletter in 2017, and am now more actively participating in the community now that mainnet is a couple hours away from launching. Although I haven't _really_ understood the soundness of Proof of Space + Proof of Time and the many implementation details meant to fend off attacks, I think the general approach of building on Bitcoin's strengths while covering its weaknesses is a robust one.

I've fiddled around in a few of their repos and have been lurking on their [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/chia_network.public). Getting started on Chia is easy on any major OS, with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) GUI releases for Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as the CLI it's built off of. If you want to earn Chia coins (it's an eco-friendly consensus model, so we call it farming instead of mining), you can get started with around 101.8 GiB of hard drive space you're willing to dedicate to Proofs of Space, around 332 GiB of temporary hard drive space during the initial set-up, and about 9-20 hours to spare, depending on whether your temp space is on an SSD or HDD.
